                  <p>My name is Liam Vogel and I'm a professional Spanish
                  language teacher working out of Burbank.
                  I just moved back from Argentina in South America
                  and now I'm starting a private foreign language school.
                  I previously studied and lived in Mexico, Guatemala,
                  Colombia, and Argentina. </p>
                  <p>I am a distinguished alumni
                  of Mexico's Iberoamericana and la Universidad Cat√≥lica
                  de la Argentina. I also am about to finish my BA in
                  Spanish Linguistics at Seattle University. Spanish is
                  my passion I would love to help you understand it and
                  teach you about the colorful cultures of Latin America.
                  Call or text me to schedule a lesson.</p>
